# Let's paint on tarpaper

Today we are going to start with a piece of tarpaper, a brush, and choose three colors. 

0. You are going to draw a curvy line from the top to the bottom starting anywhere at the top, and ending anywhere at the bottom, but it must curve and the line will bisect your canvas.  Now draw a second line parallel to your first line, ensure there is a space between these lines (1/8" - 1/2")

1. draw half of a face on one side of the curve

2. color the other side of the canvas using one of your three colors, then make at least three dots, but as many you want on this side of the curve that you just colored

3. on the same side of the curve as the dots make 3 flowers of differing sizes
